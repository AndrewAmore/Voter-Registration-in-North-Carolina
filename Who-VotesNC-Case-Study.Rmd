**Abstract**  
Political candidates are often interested in understanding factors influencing
voter registration across different demographic categories and how overall registration
probability varies. Understanding these aspects can enhance informed decision
making for campaign staffs on election related decisions, like where to focus limited
advertising budgets to sway voters. Official voter registration records and census
population estimates for counties in North Carolina were collected and analyzed 
using Bayesian hierarchical modeling strategies. The large number of demographic 
combinations limit the analysis to a random sample of just 30% of all counties. 
The final models suggest demographic attributes, like age and race, have significant
impacts on registration rates as well as significant rate differences across counties.
To explore predictive power of mulitlevel models, out-of-sample predictions on 
registration rates were computed and compared to the true values using MSE. Overall,
the fitted models display similar behavior and have high predictive accuracy for
a majority of observations. 

# Introduction
Political campaigns analyze historical election data to understand how different
demographic groups register to vote, specifically during presidential election
years when individuals are more likely to show up at the polls. This information 
can inform optimal advertising strategies, which can drum up more votes and win 
elections. Campaigns are generally interested in assessing registration differences 
amongst demographic groups and how registration tendencies vary by county, gender, 
age and party affiliation.

# Data Overview
To address the main questions of interest, two data sources were analyzed. 
Information from the [2010 U.S. Census](https://www.census.gov/data.html) was 
collected from the Federal Census Bureau website and enhanced with official
[2016 voter registration](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/) records from North Carolina. To 
combine the data, demographic field values were standardized, as the coding structure
varies slightly between State and Federal agencies. In total, there were **XX**
registered voters with unknown gender lacking a corresponding Census
category and these records were dropped. Irrelevant registration fields denoting 
precinct location were also removed. Metadata information for the combined dataset
and a sample observation, can be viewed in Table 1.

## Population Migration
The 2010 Census is assumed to represent the voter population during the 2016 
election, however, **16.3%** of all observations have more registered voters than
the demographic population estimates from the Census. Are we observing potential
voter fraud or is historical Census information from six years ago too dated to 
reflect accurate estimates? 
To understand the scope of this issue, the difference between total
registered voters and Census estimates were computed and aggregated by county. 
Figure 1 shows summaries for geographies with more than five observations for ease
of viewing. Conincidentally, **16%** of counties have median population difference
greater than **100 individuals**, however, **70%** of counties have median difference
less than **50** and **35%** have medians less than **10**. The majority of 
moderately small differences assuages some concerns of major population
shifts over the six year period. Population estimates for the "invalid" observations 
are set to the sum of registered voters, but could also be inflated with a correction
factor learned from other observations.
<!-- this could be improved by multiplying by average percent difference... -->

```

To minimize error, 30 counties were randomly selected using sampling weights 
inversely proportional to the percentage of faulty observations 
($\text{total registered voters} > \text{demographic population}$). This framework
can be extended to bootstrap resample different county combinations for parameter
estimation which reduces variation by steering our model towards more accurate 
data. An additional benefit of sub-sampling is a reduction in computation time 
for MCMC sampling for parameter estimation in Bayesian models.


```{r, sample-counties-modeling-df}
## use 1-bad_data_percent as sampling weight for county selection
weight_df = model_df %>% 
                 group_by(Geography) %>% 
                 count() %>% 
                 left_join(sample %>% group_by(Geography) %>% count(), by="Geography") %>% 
                 mutate(n.y = case_when(is.na(n.y) ~ as.integer(0), TRUE ~ n.y)) %>%
                 mutate(bad_data_percent = n.y/n.x)

weights = 1 - weight_df$bad_data_percent
counties = weight_df$Geography

## for "invalid" voter_freq, set Freq = sum of party affiliations 
## also compute new freq denominator based on given affiliation
model_df = model_df  %>%
  group_by(Geography, Age, Gender, Hispanic, Race) %>%
  summarise(party_affiliation_sum = sum(VoterFreq)) %>%
  inner_join(model_df) %>% 
  ## update Freq for Invalid Values
  mutate(Freq = case_when(
    # VoterFreq >= Freq ~ party_affiliation_sum,
    party_affiliation_sum > Freq ~ party_affiliation_sum,
    TRUE ~ Freq)) %>%
  ## compute new freq denominator. Partition the available voters to a party and add to the VoterFreq
  mutate(Affil_Freq =
           round((VoterFreq/party_affiliation_sum) * (Freq-party_affiliation_sum)) + VoterFreq)

## filter to relevant fields
test_df = model_df %>% 
  filter(!Geography %in% samp)
model_df = model_df %>% 
  filter(Geography %in% samp)
```

```{r, verify-partition-strategy}
## verify the imputed sums match the true freqs or at least are within 1
# model_df %>% 
#   ungroup() %>% 
#   group_by(Geography, Age, Gender, Hispanic, Race, Freq) %>%
#   summarize(val = sum(Affil_Freq))
# saveRDS(model_df, file="model_df.RDS")
```


## Motivating a Multilevel Model 
We are interested in understanding how demographic covariates affect the number of
registered voters ("successes") relative to respective population estimates ("trials"), 
suggesting a binomial model. However, we do not know the political party affiliation
for unregistered voters, as the Census does not ask about political affiliation and
this membership is considered latent. This is information is necessary to draw
conclusions on party membership registration influence. As an initial estimate for
this missing quantity, I impute it based on the original population Census estimates
and the political party distribution for registered voters. This new quantity is
used in place of the original estimates for inference. 
To evaluate modeling decisions, like where to apply random effects, an exploratory 
data analysis (EDA) was conducted. Figure 2 is a facet plot of different binomial
regressions on voter registration probability for two demographic categories and 
color coded by county. (A) fits regressions by county, age group and has substantially 
different trend lines across and within facets. (B) fits regressions by county, 
race and has much lower variability across facets. Plots for additional covariates
can by found in the Appendix. Gender effects are consistent across geography, party
affiliation displays consistent trends as does hispanic indicator. Continuous fields,
like total county population, were also explored in the regression analysis, but
were not included in the final model as including it lead to difficulty generating 
valid sampling distributions in brms (even with scaling and prior adjustments).

# Multilevel Models

## Model Specifications
The modeling framework can now be specified as follows. Let $\left(y_{i}, n_{i}, p_{i}\right)$
denote the number of voter registrations, demographic population and registration 
probability respectively for observation $i$. $y_{i}$ is assumed to be distributed
as a binomial random variable.
$$y_{i} \sim Binomial\left(n_{i}, \ p_{i}\right)$$
Individuals can only register to vote once, but binomial trials sample independently
with replacement. The independent draw assumption seems reasonable, as the probability 
of any one individual registering to vote is most likely independent of any other 
individual's decision (more on this later). Additionally, $\sim 70\%$ of demographic
categories in our dataset have populations $n_{i} \geq 30$. However, the demographic 
samples can be considered population estimates and may warrant a hypergeometric 
distribution, but this induces a dependence between $y_{i}$'s which is unwarranted
based on our independent registration assumption. Under the binomial model, several 
multilevel structures with varying complexity were evaluated. Table 3 displays the 
specifications.

<!-- The EDA suggests variation across counties, age groups and political -->
<!-- affiliations, but how does the covariance structure affect coefficient estimates? -->

# Results
MCMC diagnostics, like trace plots, can be viewed in the Appendix for each model.
The main questions of interest concern demographic factors influencing registration
probabilities. We are particularly interested in the following italicized questions.

**_1. How did different demographic subgroups register to vote in the 2016 election?_**  
The fixed effect estimates from each model are plotted in Figure 3 with 95% credible
regions (CR). Note, not all models include identical fixed effects, but the overlapping
estimates tend to display more shrinkage with increased model complexity.
Starting from the top of Figure 3, all Race indicators have significant impact 
on registration rate. Party affiliation displays no significant effect. Hispanic
and Gender estimates are also significant. Older individuals are also more likely
to register, but this can be attributed to having more opportunities/elections to
do so.

model_names = c("Model I", "Model II", "Model III")
models = list(m1, m2, m3)
num_models = length(model_names)
tst = c()
for(i in 1:num_models){
  tst = rbind(tst, compute_fixed_effect_intervals(models[[i]], model_names[i]))
}

        axis.title.y=element_blank()) + 
    geom_vline(xintercept =0, linetype="dashed", color="darkred", size=0.5)
```

**_2. Did the overall odds of registering differ by county in 2016? Which counties differ the most from other counties?_**  
Only 30 counties are included in this analysis and the list can be viewed in the 
Appendix. The random intercepts from Model I, with 95% CR are displayed in Figure
4. Tyrrell, the only county in the dataset without any "invalid" observations has
the lowest registration effect, while **43%** of counties have no detectable effect.

  geom_vline(xintercept =0, linetype="dashed", color="darkred", size=0.5) +
  ggtitle("County Effect on Voter Registration") +
  xlab("Change in Log Odds")
```

**_3. How did the registration rates differ between genders for different party affiliations?_**  
Using Model II we can look at the gender effect within each political party from
random slope estimates and assess the relative change in log odds from the baseline
gender (Female). Figure 5 shows 95% CRs and point estimates. Males across all political 
parties are less likely to register than corresponding females and republican 
males register at the highest rates.

        axis.title.y=element_blank()) +
  ggtitle("Gender Effect on Registration Rates by Political Party") +
  xlab("Change in Log Odds")
```

\newpage

**_4. How did registration rates differ between age groups for the different party affiliations?_**  
Using Model III we can look at the age effect within each political party from 
random slope estimates assess the relative change in log odds from the baseline
age (18-25). Figure 6 shows 95% CRs and point estimates. In almost all age categories
republicans are more likely to register than other political parties. We also 
see registration rate across all parties as age increases.

        axis.title.y=element_blank()) +
  ggtitle("Age Effects on Registration Rates by Political Party") +
  xlab("Change in Log Odds")
```

**Predictive Accuracy**  
In addition to inference, we are interested in predicting registered voters for
each demographic combination. 70% of our data is unseen by the model and constitutes
the test set. For ease of viewing, I've randomly selected one unseen county and 
display the predictive accurarcy for every demographic combination in Figure 7.
The error is computed as the difference between the actual number of registered 
voters and the model prediction. Dashed lines on Figure 7 denote average error. 
Surprisingly, Model I has the best predictive performance, with average error 
roughly 10 individuals, but median error of less than one. 

```{r, predictive-accuracy, include=TRUE, fig.height=3.75, fig.cap="Predictive Accuracy for One Unseen County Across All Demographic Groups"}

**Limitations**  
Several limitations have been mentioned throughout and are summarized. First,
we have concerns about the viability of the 2010 Census for population estimates
in 2016 as some observations have more voter registrations than population estimates.
A weighted sub-sampling strategy was introduced to minimize the statistical impact,
but only addresses detectable observations where $registration \ > \ population$.
A valid concern is that all demographic populations undergo some change over the
six year period. A potential solution is to impute or average the demographic populations
in 2016 using estimates from both the 2010 and 2020 Censuses.

Another limitation is from the sub-sampling strategy which limits our data usage
to only $30\%$ of available counties and introduces additional variability. To 
alleviate this, one could leverage the entire dataset by either acquiring more 
computation power, letting models run for longer (most complex model takes 
$\sim 12 \text{ hours}$ to run), adopt a bootstrap resampling procedure to run
the model multiple times with different county combinations (also requires more 
computation time), and/or specify simpler models with less random effects that 
take less time to run.

An additional limitation is the unknown population estimates for political party 
affiliations. The Census data only quantifies innate categories and does not contain
information regarding party affiliation. These totals were imputed from available
fields based on the party distribution from registered voters within each demographic
group. This introduces another source of error, but is necessary if we want to 
make inferences about party affiliation. 

Lastly, the Gelman book indicates overdisperion is almost always a problem in 
binomial regression models as there is no independent variance term. If overdispersion
is present, our estimates will be overconfident. Time constraints prevented testing
for overdispersion and applying an uncertainty adjustment to estimates.

**Conclusion**  
Historical voting records and Census population estimates were used to evaluate 
demographic differences in registration tendencies. Three Bayesian multilevel
models were created to address specific questions of interest using different
effect structures. The full dataset was sub-sample to improve computation time, but
may lead to higher variance estimates. Preliminary results suggest significant
differences in registration tendencies across demographic categories in North
Carolina.
